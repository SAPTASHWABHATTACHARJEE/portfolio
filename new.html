								I am Saptashwa Bhattacharjee, a senior undergraduate student in the 
								Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the 
								Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.
								<hr color=#434750>

								I was born on 24<sup>th</sup> of August 2002 in a small town named Malda in 
								the state of West Bengal, India. Born in a lower-middle-class family, I heard 
								about the financial crisis, my elders had to endure. My eldest uncle, an exceptional 
								student received an offer from medical school for undergraduate studies. However, 
								an intense financial crisis prevented him from seeking admission. His paramount 
								sacrifice had a profound impact on my development, and his grief to date has made me 
								recognize the value of education. 
								<hr color=#434750>

								I have been fascinated by MOSFETs since I was introduced to it in my 2nd year of 
								undergraduate study and decided to dig deeper into it. I started by reading the book 
								<i>"Microelectronics"</i> and then continued exploring the next book in the series: <i>"Design of 
								Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits"</i> series by Behzad Razavi. Following this, I was thoroughly trained 
								in Cadence in the Advanced VLSI lab.	 
								<hr color=#434750>
								
								My area of interest is Mixed Signal IC Design, Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits with a particular focus 
								on oscillators, PLL, and making designs that are radiation hardened for space applications.
								<hr color=#434750>
								A few days back, an institute lecture organized by the Office of International Relations hosted Professor T. Venkatesan 
								of the University of Oklahoma on "Recent Advances in Memristors for Neuromorphic Circuits." From then on, I got 
								interested in this and thought that I could learn about it, explore it, and work in this domain. I read the first-ever 
								paper about memristor that L. Chua published in IEEE. I feel that the memristor is a relatively new concept, with many 
								applications like memristor-based memory design still untapped.

		My work focuses on designing a novel Voltage Controlled Oscillator for Indian
		Space Research Organisation (ISRO) which can work for a frequency range of about 500MHz to 1.5GHz for a 
		range of control voltages from 0 to 1.8V. Several different schemes were implemented such as using pmos input device, 
		nmos input device, using native nmos. I tried using mimcap which has higher capacitance per unit area as compared to moscap. 
		Apart from these, I also has to make it radiation hardened by design (RHBD) to tackle Single effect events (SEE) by dividing 
		the each stage into several layers. I designed the enitre layout in Cadence Layout Suite and checked DRC and LVS.
	    I also extracted parasitic capacitances using PEX simulation. After this, the post-layout simulation was carried out which 
		showed some degradation in performace as compared to the theoritical frequency range. The layout has been modified
		thereafter. Pad Integration was also done. The design is currently ready for fabrication.</p>

		Designed a transistor level schematic in LTSpice using 180nm predictive technology model. A cascode 2 stage 
		OP-AMP with a open loop gain of around 10000 and a closed loop gain( using capacitive feedback) of 100. After this,
		a Voltage to Current converter has been made which converts the output voltage of the OP-AMP into current. this
		current serves as the input of the current controlled oscillator (CCO). The disgned CCO is a currret starved inverter
		configuration. The output of the CCO us digital in nature with a linear current verses frequency plot for a 
		frequency upto 13MHz. The output of the CCO has been fed to a comparator to obtain a rectangular waveform with full
		swing from 0 to 1.8V. This digital waveform goes to a counter which counts the number of pulses in a specific period.
