    <td align="justify"><p>I am Saptashwa Bhattacharjee, a senior undergraduate student in the
        Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute
        of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.<br><br>

        I was born on 24th of August 2002 in a small town named Malda in the state of West Bengal,
        India. Born in a lower-middle-class family, I heard about the financial crisis, my elders
        had to endure. My eldest uncle, an exceptional student received an offer from medical school
        for undergraduate studies. However, an intense financial crisis prevented him from seeking admission.
        His paramount sacrifice had a profound impact on my development, and his grief to date has made me
        recognize the value of education.<br><br>

        I have been fascinated by MOSFETs since I was introduced to it in my 2nd year of undergraduate study
        and decided to dig deeper into it. I started by reading the book "Microelectronics" and then continued
        exploring the next book in the series: "Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits" series by Behzad Razavi.
        Following this, I was thoroughly trained in Cadence in the Advanced VLSI lab.<br><br>

        A few days back, an institute lecture organized by the Office of International Relations hosted
        Professor T. Venkatesan of the University of Oklahoma on "Recent Advances in Memristors for Neuromorphic
        Circuits." From then on, I got interested in this and thought that I could learn about it, explore it, and
        work in this domain. I read the first-ever paper about memristor that L. Chua published in IEEE.</p></td>
