            <b>Research description:</b> <p>This research focuses on the design of an ultra wideband (UWB) transceiver for use in 
            an innovative wireless communication system for wireless sensors including active RFID tags, environmental 
            sensors, positioning sensors, wireless headsets or smart phones. Given the small amount of energy 
            available in the batteries of these devices and the importance of their autonomy, it is essential to 
            minimize the energy consumption of wireless transceivers needed in these applications. In order to 
            attain this goal, ultra-wideband technology has the potential to significantly reduce the energy 
            consumption of transceivers in comparison to what is possible with traditional architectures. That 
            said, the design of an ultra wideband transceiver that allows continuous operation while dissipating 
            energy ten times lower than the state of the art is a challenge that requires a sound architecture.  The project goal 
            is to develop innovative integrated circuits for use in a UWB transceiver architecture and design printed circuit boards 
            for the testing of existing innovative circuits introduced by our group.</p>

        <li>
            <b>Research description:</b> <p> Fractional PLLs normally have relatively low bandwidths to avoid reference spurs.
            The reason for this is that the average frequency is achieved by switching between whole numbered dividers. 
            In this internship we shall explore means to keep reference spurs low while maintaining a high PLL bandwdith 
            to cut VCO noise. This idea should be realised in an optimal fashion based on the modelling. Additionally, the behaviour 
            of high frequency PLLs are very often strongly influenced by the microchip layout. The effect of parasitic resistance, capacitance, 
            and inductance obtained after post-layout extraction will be investigated. Our study will consider most of the parasitic effects 
            of the layout. The differences to a simulation only considering the schematic should be understood and the effect to the 
            parameters of the modelling should be realized.</p>

            to a holistic pedagogic ideology for the development of creative students of science. This has been made possible 
            by systematic research on educational needs of gifted individuals.

            This scheme caters to the development of creative undergraduate students studying  Basic Sciences, Engineering & 
            Medicine in registered institutions of West Bengal. It aims to the conservation of scientific talent and the nation's 
            need for science and technology personnel can be met. 
            
            The motivational program for this group involves exposures to the field of creative thinking through contact programs 
            with creative minds. The nurture and enrichment programs involve educational tours, entitlement to other scholarships, 
            seminar programs and project work in groups.<br>
