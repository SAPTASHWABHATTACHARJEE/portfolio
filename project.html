        <img src="UWB.png" alt="hehe" width="400px" />&nbsp;</td>
        <td align="justify"><p>In 2002, the Federal Communication Commission allocated a 7.5 GHz bandwidth 
        (3.1-10.6 GHz) for ultra-wideband devices. This large bandwidth is achieved by using sub-nanosecond pulses and 
        allows us to transmit data at high speeds. However, the maximum transmitted signal power, even if the entire spectrum 
        is utilized, is -14.3 dBm. This restricts the communication range. So, prior works have proposed 
        innovative modulation schemes that increases the transmission power.<br><br>

        The biggest advantage of UWB communication is that the extremely narrow, low-duty cycle pulses significantly reduces 
        the power consumption of the transceiver. Non-coherent receivers that use integrators for energy detection
        are relatively less complex. To achieve a low bit error rate, it is essential to integrate the
        signal from the correct instant and for the correct duration. So, there must be a
        synchronization between the received signal and the integration window. In most of the prior literature, a PLL 
        has been used along with digital control logic to generate integration windows having different phases.<br><br>
        
        My key contributions in this work are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>I mathematically demonstrated a modulation scheme named Analog Pulse-Width Modulation (A-PWM), where 4-bits of 
        digital data are encoded in the form of the width of a rail-to-rail pulse. The pulse duration is the digital equivalent 
        of the 4-bit binary word*100 ps. It has been shown that the energy per bit increases in this modulation scheme, 
        resulting in enhanced communication range and low bit error rate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Using the A-PWM modulation scheme, I proposed a novel non-coherent receiver architecture that does not
        use a PLL for synchronization purpose. The proposed architecture only relies upon a squarer and time-interleaved
        integrator for energy collection followed by a charge-pump for generating a ramp signal, which is then
        sampled and digitized by a 4-bit SAR ADC.</p></li>
        <li><p>Designed the Gilbert-cell based analog squarer and time-interleaved integrator as a part of the
        receiver front-end in TSMC 180nm technology node. The detailed implementation is presented in the
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUG1IHETVVBnvzgurck00iJhnRELP7rZ/view?usp=drive_link">report</a>.</p></li>

        <h1>Design of RHBD Cross-coupled Quadrature VCO</h1>
        <table class="imgtable"><tr>
        <td align="justify"><p>The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) required a 1 Gbps
        Serializer-Deserializer (SERDES) module, to be used in high data-rate modulators and high-speed
        solid state drivers for data storage. It consists of VCO, PLL, LVDS driver and receiver as its
        building blocks. My contribution was on the design of the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO).<br><br>

        Electronic circuits, when operated in space, experience sudden
        charge injection in transistor junctions and unwanted perturbations in IC operation, called
        Single Event Effects (SEEs). So, circuits must be radiation-hardened before operating them in space.
        Prior designs for SEE-tolerant VCO used a majority voting scheme that used three parallel VCOs with pair-wise
        capacitive cross-coupling between corresponding stages. This adds asymmetry to the VCO phases and makes one of
        the phases unequal. Also, it does not ensure radiation tolerance at the output of the majority voting gate.<br><br>

        The salient features of this work are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>We designed a VCO with an even number of equally-spaced phases (as required in half-rate or quadrature-rate
        clock and data recovery circuits).</p></li>
        <li><p>The proposed scheme does not rely on any majority voting gate and hence does not require any additional stage,
        thereby mitigating any asymmetry and also reducing hardware overhead.</p></li>
        <li><p>Each stage of the oscillator is split into N parallel branches, all of whose outputs are coupled to the
        stage output by a parallel RC network. Coupling only through a capacitor fails to establish proper DC conditions.
        So, large resistors are placed in parallel to establish a well-defined DC operating point.</p></li>
        <li><p>In this manner, the effect of a strike on any one of the branches gets suppressed by a factor of N at
        the stage output node.</p></li>
        <li><p>The radiation-hardened VCO shows a nearly 80% reduction in clock jitter upon a radiation strike compared to
        its unhardened counterpart.</p></li>
        <li><p>We taped out the entire chip in SCL 180nm. This work resulted in a patent application for a novel VCO.
